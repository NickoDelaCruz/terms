      <p><span class="clickable3">Variable naming conventions</span></p>
     </div>
     <div id="vnc-show">
      <p> In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
    </div>
     <div id="f-hidden">
      <p><span class="clickable4">Functions</span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="f-show">
      <p>a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value<p>
    </div>
    <div id="m-hidden">
     <p><span class ="clickable5">Method</span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="m-show">
      <p> A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="a-hidden">
     <p><span class="clickable6">Argument</span><p>
    </div>
    <div id="a-show">
     <p> In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="p-hide">
      <p><span class="clickable7">Parameter</span><p>
    </div>
    <div id="p-show">
      <p> A parameter is a special kind of variable in computer programming language that is used to pass information between functions or procedures. The actual information passed is called an argument.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="r-hidden">
      <p><span class="clickable8">Return</span><p>
    </div>
    <div id="r-show">
      <p>A return statement is the information that part of a computer program gives to another part. In object-oriented programming, the term return is used by methods to perform an output.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="c-hidden">
      <p><span class="clickable9">Chaining Methods</span><p>
      </div>
    <div id="c-show">
      <p>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. ... A similar syntax is method cascading, where after the method call the expression evaluates to the current object, not the return value of the method.<p>
    </div>
    <div id="s-hidden">
      <p><span class="clickable10">Strings</span><p>
      </div>
    <div id="s-show">
      <p>In computer science a string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer)<p>
    </div>
    <div id="b-hide">
     <p><span class="clickable11">Booleans</span><p>
    </div>

    <div id="b-show">
     <p> a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u-hide">
     <p><span class="clickable12">Undefined</span></p>
  </div>
  <div id="u-show">
     <p>An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been previously declared by that code. </p>
   </div>
   <div id="n-hidden">
     <p><span class="clickable13">NaN</span></p>
  </div>
  <div id="n-show">
    <p>In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="e-hidden">
    <p><span class="clickable14">Escape</span></p>
  </div>
  <div id="e-show">
    <p>Invented by Bob Bemer, an escape sequence is two or more characters that often begin with an escape character that tells the computer or software program to perform a function or command. ... Below is an example of how an escape sequence appears to a computer and then how it is displayed to the user</p>
